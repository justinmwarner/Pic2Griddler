# How to play
So, this puzzle is normally called:
    * Griddler
    * Nonogram.  
    * Hanjie
    * Paint by Numbers

The numbers on the left and top of the grid represent the number of blocks you have in a consecutive row.  They can be multiple colors, and in some cases, can be triangles (We're **not** interested in this).  You build your picture based on these hints.  So if we have a grid that looks like such:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>4</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
</table>

Becomes:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>2</th>
		<th>4</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>4</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>2</th>
		<th> </th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th>X</th>
		<th> </th>
	</tr>
</table>
